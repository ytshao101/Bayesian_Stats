This folder contains code for Bayesian linear regression.

Contrary to frequentist OLS approach, BLS impose a prior distribution on the parameter of interest, 
i.e. $\beta$, and use Gibbs sampling to simulate posteriors and perform predictions.

When data is large compared to prior covariance matrix, BLS $\to$ OLS.
Otherwise, BLS is a better approach.
